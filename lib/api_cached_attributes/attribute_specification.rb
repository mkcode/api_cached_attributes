module ApiCachedAttributes
  # A value object representing an attribute defined in
  # ApiCachedAttributes::Base. An AttributeSpecification contains the
  # attributes' method name, its resource, and its API client that is used for
  # lookup. It also calculates its `key` which is used to lookup its value in
  # storage.
  #
  # scope is evaluated outside of this object and should remain unchanged
  # throughout its life cycle. scope is used in building the attribute's key and
  # its equality. target_object on the other hand is just a reference to the
  # object that scope was evaluated on. It may change throughout the attribute's
  # life cycle and is not used in determining equality.
