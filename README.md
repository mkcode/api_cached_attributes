Add resiliency, speed, and familiarity to the APIs your app relies on.
Features:

 * A simple DSL for resource oriented APIs.
 * Work with foreign APIs in the same way you work with ActiveRecord associations.
 * Transparently caches API responses for major performance gains.
 * Don't fail when APIs your app relies on are momentarily down.
 * Respect your APIs Cache-Control header. Or don't. It's up to you.
 * Configurable logging and error reporting.
 * Trivial to add support for your new API client.

## Getting started

has_remote allows you to easily create ruby style domain objects (or models) that represents a foreign API. These `remote_resources` can be mixed in and associated with other ActiveRecord models in the same way you work with your other ActiveRecord models. Using this pattern and these conventions yields some major performance gains, through caching and fast and robust development through familiarity.

A few steps to get started:

Create a `remote_resource`, such as:

> in `app/remote_resources/github_user.rb`

```ruby
class GithubUser < HasRemote::Resource
  client { Octokit::Client.new }
  resource { |client, scope| client.user(scope[:github_login]) }

  attribute :id
  attribute :avatar_url

  ...
end
```

Associate it with your ActiveRecord `User` model:

> in `app/models/user.rb`

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_remote :github_user, scope: :github_login

  ...
end
```

And you may now use it, just like your other models.

```ruby
user = User.find(1)

user.github_user.login
user.github_user.avatar_url
```

Behind the scene, `has_remote` issued a get request to the GitHub API and cached the response. Future github_user calls will be fast!

A simple demonstration Rails application can be found here: TODO: update link.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'remote_resource'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install remote_resource


### Setup

In a initializer, like `config/initializers/remote_resource.rb`, you may override the following options:

```ruby
# Setup global storages. For now there is only redis and memory. Default is one
# Memory store.

require 'remote_resource/storage/redis'
ApiCachedAttributes.storages = [
  ApiCachedAttributes::Storage::Redis.new( Redis.new(url:nil) )
]

# Setup a logger

ApiCachedAttributes.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)

# Setup a lookup method. Only default for now, but the `cache_control` option
# may be changed to true or false. True will always revalidate. False will never
# revalidate. :cache_control respects the Cache-Control header.

require 'remote_resource/lookup/default'
ApiCachedAttributes.lookup_method = ApiCachedAttributes::Lookup::Default.new(validate: true)
```

### Defining an API

By convention, api attribute classes are located under app/api_attributes and
always suffixed with _attributes. This folder is automatically added to your
Rails eager loaded paths.

In `app/api_attributes/github_user_attributes`:

```ruby
class GithubUserAttributes < ApiCachedAttributes::Base
  client { Octokit::Client.new }

  default_resource { |client, scope| client.user(scope[:github_login]) }

  attribute :id
  attribute :avatar_url
  attribute :url
  attribute :html_url
  attribute :type
  attribute :name
  attribute :company
  attribute :email
  attribute :public_repos
  attribute :updated_at
  attribute :created_at
end
```

The are 3 parts that every API definition class needs.

 * __client__: You return an instance of the web client that the API uses in a block. That block yields the scope. (More on scope later.)

 * __default_resource__: The resource that attributes with no second argument
   use. Roughly corresponds to a web request. The block is given the client
   (which was returned from the client block above) and the scope. It then
   issues a web request and returns a response. The response object must respond
   to the `to_hash` method.

 * __named_resource__: This is like the default resource except, the attribute's
   second argument refers to the named_resource for it to use.

 * __attribute__: A single piece of data from the resource (or web) response.
   This will be mapped to a method later. Optionally takes a second symbol
   argument referring to a non-default resource.

### Updating & Custom methods

ApiCachedAttributes allows you to call any method that your API client defines and compose new methods from those within the Base class definition. Expanding on the above example:

In `app/api_attributes/github_user_attributes`:

```ruby
class GithubUserAttributes < ApiCachedAttributes::Base
  client { Octokit::Client.new }

  default_resource { |client, scope| client.user(scope[:github_login]) }

  attribute :id
  ...
  attribute :created_at

  def markdown_summary
    client.markdown "# A big hello to #{name}!!!"
  end
end
```

The above `markdown_summary` method references client, which is what is returned from the above client block. The following methods are available within a ApiCachedAttributes::Base class.

 * __client__ - returns the evaluated client block.

 * __resource(resource_name)__ - returns the evaluated resource block for the provided name. You may use `:default` to access the `default_resource` return value.

 ...more to come...

### Instantiating Api Resource Objects

The above `GithubUserAttributes` example class may be instantiated on it's own. The initializer takes the scope argument as an options Hash. In the above `GithubUserAttributes` example, because in our default_resource block, we use `scope[:github_login]`, we should send a `:github_login` option into the constructor. For example:

```ruby
github_user = GithubUserAttributes.new(github_login: 'mkcode')
```

Now that we have an instance, we may call any of our custom defined methods on it.

```ruby
github_user.markdown_summary
#=> "<h1>A big hello to Chris Ewald!!!</h1>"
```

We also may call any of our defined attributes. Ex:

```ruby
github_user.name
#=> "Chris Ewald"
```

### Creating hybrid domain objects

In `app/models/github_user`:

```ruby
class GithubUser < ActiveRecord::Base
  validates :github_login, presence: true, uniqueness: true

  remote_resource :github_user, scope: :github_login,
    attributes_map: { id: :github_id, updated_at: :github_updated_at,
                      created_at: :github_created_at }
end
```

We call __remote_resource__ to include the previously defined attributes in the GithubUser model to create a hybrid domain object. This is partially backed by the database, and partially backed by the Github API.

We __scope: github_login__ option, collects the value of github_login on this model and sends this into the GithubUserAttributes class to make a unique client and resource. It does not need to be persisted (saved) to work.

The __attribues_map__ option, overrides the default method names on GithubUser. Because the model already has an id, updated_at, and created_at, we prefix the github api values with github. A `prefix` option is also available if all the defined methods shoudl be prefixed as well.

The __validates__ line is not needed, but helps. Trying to access the attributes without a github_login set, will cause an error. And in this table, conceptually, it makes sense for one record per user, which is why we validate uniqueness as well.

### Extending other domain object

If you do not use ActiveRecord in your app, you may still use remote_resource by simply extending the Bridge module. Ex:

```ruby
class MyPoroDomainObject
  extend ApiCachedAttributes::Bridge # this includes the remote_resource_method

  remote_resource :github_user
end

```

### Notifications

There are 4 ActiveSupport notifications that you may subscribe to, to do in depth profiling of this gem:

  * find.remote_resource
  * storage_lookup.remote_resource
  * http_head.remote_resource
  * http_get.remote_resource

ActiveSupport::Notifications.subscribe('http_get.remote_resource') do |name, _start, _fin, _id, _payload|
  puts "HTTP_GET #{name}"
end

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
